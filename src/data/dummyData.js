This full-day adventure begins with an exciting 4x4 ride through the northern terrain, followed by a scenic hike to the Sharrë Waterfall, where untouched nature meets refreshing mountain springs. Take time to swim in the crystal-clear waters, explore hidden trails, and relax during a picnic lunch surrounded by forested hills. Ideal for nature lovers and adventurers, this tour combines adrenaline, serenity, and raw Albanian wilderness in one unforgettable day.",
